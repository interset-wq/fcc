# Learn Data Structures by Building the Merge Sort Algorithm 通过构建归并排序算法学习数据结构

## Abstract

The Merge Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle.

In this project, you'll learn how to interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm.

归并排序算法是一种基于分治原则的排序算法。

在本项目中，你将学习如何通过使用归并排序算法对一组随机数字进行排序，来与数据结构进行交互。

This is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer principle to sort collections of data. That is, it 'divides' a collection into smaller sub-parts, and 'conquers' the sub-parts by sorting them independently, then merges the sorted sub-parts.

The merge sort algorithm mainly performs three actions:

Divide an unsorted sequence of items into sub-parts
Sort the items in the sub-parts
Merge the sorted sub-parts
The above happens recursively until the sub-parts are merged into the complete sorted sequence. Let's start by dividing the sequence.
