# Learn Tree Traversal by Building a Binary Search Tree通过构建二叉搜索树学习树的遍历

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an common data structure where data is sorted hierarchically.

In this project, you'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. You'll also learn key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

二叉搜索树（BST）是一种常见的数据结构，其中的数据按层次进行排序。

在本项目中，你将学习如何构建自己的二叉搜索树，并执行中序遍历。你还将学习插入、搜索和删除等关键操作。

In this project, you are going to create a Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node, allowing for efficient searching and sorting operations.

This is what a Binary Search Tree looks like:
