# Build a Curriculum Outline

Welcome to freeCodeCamp!

This workshop will serve as your introduction to HTML and coding in general. You will learn about headings and paragraph elements.

Step 1
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage. This is your code editor, where you'll write HTML.

Find line 1 in the editor and type this text:

Welcome to freeCodeCamp
When you are done, click the "check your code" button to see if it's correct.

Step 2
HTML is made up of elements. The first one you will use is the h1 element:

<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>
It starts with an opening tag (<h1>), ends with a closing tag (</h1>), and has the text it will display in between the tags.

Turn your Welcome to freeCodeCamp text into an h1 element by adding an opening tag in front of it, and a closing tag after it.

Step 3
Notice that the HTML you write in the editor shows up in the preview. In this workshop, you will write the HTML for a partial curriculum webpage.

Below your h1 element, type the following on the empty line:

Full Stack Curriculum

Step 4
An h1 element is the main heading of a webpage and you should only use one per page. h2 elements represent subheadings. You can have multiple per page and they look like this:

<h2>This is a subheading.</h2>
Turn the Full Stack Curriculum text into an h2 element by surrounding it with opening and closing h2 tags.

Step 5
Below the other two lines of text, add:

Learn the skills to become a full stack developer

Step 6
When you need to add a paragraph to a webpage, you can use the p element like this:

<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
Turn Learn the skills to become a full stack developer into a paragraph element.

Step 7
There are six heading elements in HTML: h1 through h6. They're used to show the importance of sections on your webpage, with h1 being the most important and h6 the least.

Below your p element, add an h3 heading with the text:

Introduction to HTML

Step 8
Notice that each heading looks a little different in the preview. Same with the paragraph.

Next, add another p element that displays the following text:

HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage

Step 9
You're getting the hang of it. Next, add another h3 element at the bottom of the editor with the text:

Introduction to CSS

Step 10
While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS is used to add style — things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

Below the h3 you just added, add another paragraph element with the text:

CSS is used to style a webpage

Step 11
Finally, JavaScript makes your webpage interactive — it lets you tell the page what to do when someone clicks a button, submits a form, or many other things.

For the last step of the workshop, add another h3 and p element to the page describing JavaScript.

First, add an h3 element with the text:

Introduction to JavaScript
Then, below that h3 element, add a p element with the following text:

JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage
