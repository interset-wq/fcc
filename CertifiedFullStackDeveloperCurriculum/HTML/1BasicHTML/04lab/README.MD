Your job is to fix all of the errors so Sally can continue building her page.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

Replace the href attribute with the correct attribute for the image source.
Replace the att attribute with the correct attribute representing short, descriptive text for images.
Remove the </img> closing tag because img elements are void elements and don't have closing tags.

Replace both src attributes with the correct attributes used to specify URLs.
