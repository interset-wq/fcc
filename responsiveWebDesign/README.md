# Responsive Web Design

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: `HTML` (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and `CSS` (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a `cat photo app` to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by `building a penguin`, and best practices for accessibility by `building a quiz site`.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a `photo gallery` with Flexbox, and a `magazine article` layout with CSS Grid.

Note: Some browser extensions, such as ad-blockers and dark mode extensions can interfere with the tests. If you face issues, we recommend disabling extensions that modify the content or layout of pages, while taking the course.
